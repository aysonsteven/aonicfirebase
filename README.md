#Setting up Aonic
*use your ip address in proxyURL @ionic.config.js
    *to check your ip address type "ipconfig" @cmd
    *http://192.168.1.1:8000/ *sample*
  *In package.json you may want to change the ionic: serve and provide the ip address you used in ionic.config.json and put port 8000
    *so you don't need to provide your address and port every time you serve.
      *sample* "ionic:serve": "ionic-app-scripts serve --address 192.168.1.1 --port  8000"
